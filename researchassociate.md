### Now Hiring! 

#### Research Associate / Fellow (Postdoc/Senior Postdoc) position on Neural Conversational AI 
We seek a candidate who will lead and contribute to research projects on open-domain conversational artificial intelligence at the intersection of NLP, ML, and Information Retrieval. Our goal is to make significant advances to open-domain conversational assistants by bridging search-based information agents and neural-symbolic reasoning. This includes research on open-domain long-form question answering, explainable AI, automatic knowledge base construction, and conversational search/task-based dialogue systems. The ideal candidate has in-depth knowledge of state-of-the-art neural language model architectures. Candidates should have a PhD (or equivalent qualification) or have held a previous postdoctoral position in machine learning, natural language processing, information retrieval, or related areas. 

The position is working with PI, Jeff Dalton, and is funded by a UKRI Turing AI Acceleration Fellowship in collaboration with the Alan Turing Institute on "Neural Conversational Information Seeking Assistants." The fellowship is part of a programme to attract talented AI researchers to the UK to promote transformative and innovative research. Benefits for research staff includes generous travel support and opportunities to collaborate with leading research groups (academic and industry) across the UK, Europe, and beyond. Involvement in teaching is possible, but not required. 

This post qualifies for a work visa and is open to international applicants. Remote work within the UK is possible given current conditions.
