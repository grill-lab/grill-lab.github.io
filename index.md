The Glasgow Representation and Information Learning Lab, or GRILL for short, is a research group in the [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/).  We are part of the [Information, Data and Analysis](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/) Section and world-leading [Information Retrieval](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/informationretrieval/) group.

Our research aims to develop new methods for machine understanding of natural language text and data.  We develop new algorithms and techniques to tackle challenging problems in representing knowledge, language understanding, and information seeking. We aim to push the boundaries of machine intelligence using deep neural networks as well as enabling practical text processing applications.  Our recent efforts focus on Conversational Information Seeking, dialogue systems, multi-task information extraction, and multi-modal (music and ECG) representation learning. 

Our work is funded by grants from [Google](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/announcing-2019-google-faculty-research.html), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/blog/recipients-of-the-2019-amazon-research-awards-announced), and [Bloomberg](https://www.techatbloomberg.com/blog/announcing-2019-bloomberg-data-science-research-grant-winners/) research.
