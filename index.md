The Generalized Representation and Information Learning Lab, or GRILL is a research that develops new methods for machine understanding of natural language text and data.  Starting in Autumn 2023, GRILL is a research group at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics). We are part of the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) (ILCC), one of the world's leading groups in language technologies and NLP. Previously, GRILL was part of the [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/).

Our research aims to develop new algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques to tackle challenging problems in explainable machine reasoning, language understanding, and information seeking. We push the boundaries of machine intelligence using deep neural networks to enable practical applications.  Our recent efforts focus on Conversational Information Seeking, dialogue systems, multi-task information extraction, and multi-modal (music and ECG) representation learning. 

Our work is funded by grants from [Google](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/announcing-2019-google-faculty-research.html), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/blog/recipients-of-the-2019-amazon-research-awards-announced), [Bloomberg](https://www.techatbloomberg.com/blog/announcing-2019-bloomberg-data-science-research-grant-winners/) research, and [The Data Lab](https://www.thedatalab.com/). We are contribute to the [SOCIAL CDT](https://socialcdt.org/), a Centre for Doctoral Training on socially intelligent artifical agents.
