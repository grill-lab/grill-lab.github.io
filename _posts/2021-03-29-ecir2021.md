GRILL Lab is presenting research and participating at ECIR 2021. 

Visiting PhD student [Shahrzad Naseri](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shnaseri/) is presenting [CEQE: Contextualized Embeddings for Query Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05256)
We propose a new model, Contextualized Embeddings for Query Expansion (CEQE), that utilizes query-focused contextualized embedding vectors. We study the behavior of contextual representations generated for query expansion in ad-hoc document retrieval.

Jeff Dalton also chaired the session on [Conversational Search](https://www.ecir2021.eu/detailed-program/). 

We are also now [hiring for a Research Associate (Postdoc)](../researchassociate) and PhD students in neural information assistants.
