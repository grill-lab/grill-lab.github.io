<strong>Alexa TaskBot Challenge</strong>

GRILL is one of ten teams selected to 
compete in the first <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexaprize">Alexa Taskbot Challenge</a>. GRILL will be going head-to-head against nine of the leading conversational AI research groups in the world (<a href="https://www.amazon.science/academic-engagements/ten-university-teams-selected-to-participate-in-alexa-prize-taskbot-challenge">official announcement</a>). 

Read the full details in the University of Glasgow news: [UofG students turn up the heat on Conversational AI](https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_794072_en.html). 

The team is excited to take the latest cutting edge research in multi-modal deep learning and language understanding out of the lab and into your kitchen. 

The team’s leader, Carlos Gemmell, says: “We’re thrilled that our entry was successful and we’re excited to begin work 
on the Alexa Taskbot project. The project aims to develop new conversational question answering technology specialized for complex tasks using 
state-of-the-art neural deep learning models. Having access to Alexa users around the world will allow us to receive 
real-time feedback and help us to make it an invaluable task assistant.”
