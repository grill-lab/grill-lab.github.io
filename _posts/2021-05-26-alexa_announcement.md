<strong>Alexa TaskBot Challenge</strong>

GRILL is one of just ten teams chosen by Amazon from more than 125 entries across 15 countries to 
compete in the first Alexa Taskbot Challenge (<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexaprize">challenge description</a>). 
The Glasgow team will receive a research grant of $250,000 (£176,500) and free access to Amazon Web Services.

The GRILL team consists of School of Computing Science graduate students Sophie Fischer, Carlos Gemmell, Iain Mackie, 
Paul Owoicho, and Federico Rossetto. Dr. Jeff Dalton is the team’s faculty advisor and will help guide the project.  
Jeff will draw inspiration from his cooking background, having previously been a Masterchef contestant in the American 
version in 2011.

The team’s leader, Carlos Gemmell, said: “We’re thrilled that our entry was successful and we’re excited to begin work 
on the Alexa Taskbot project.” 
 
“Over the next 12 months, we’ll develop novel multimodal deep learning algorithms grounded in tasks that people do in 
the real world. It will be capable of understanding what users require when performing a task and how to guide them 
through it by reasoning over past interactions, a structured representation of the task, and curated documents.” 
 
“The project aims to develop new conversational question answering technology specialized for complex tasks using 
state-of-the-art neural deep learning models. Having access to Alexa users around the world will allow us to receive 
real-time feedback and help us to make it an invaluable task assistant.”

GRILL will be going head-to-head against 9 of the best conversational AI research groups in the world (<a href="https://www.amazon.science/academic-engagements/ten-university-teams-selected-to-participate-in-alexa-prize-taskbot-challenge">official announcement</a>).

<strong>Research</strong>

Our scientific approach to the TaskBot challenge comes from our team’s background in the fields of Information Retrieval 
and Information Extraction, with a focus on user-centric modelling of complex information tasks. 
Our approach is based on retrieval, extraction, and question answering on large web corpora and knowledge graphs.

The system we envision is capable of dynamically adapting to new
domains from machine reading of semi-structured documents with
limited or even no human supervision. It should be capable of reasoning over multiple data modalities present in the real world, and
should fluidly guide a user through complex tasks while remaining
open to domain questions. 

This ambitious goal requires us to make
contributions to new neural models for dialogue task structure, new
multi-modal representations that are grounded in text, images, and
video, and new information extraction techniques to automatically
extract task structures from semi-structured documents.
