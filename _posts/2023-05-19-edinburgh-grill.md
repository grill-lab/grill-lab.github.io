<strong>Summer News - Moving to Edinburgh and More</strong>

<img src="https://media.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/logos/Informatics_Uni_vertical.png" height="25%" width="25%">

Just in time for Summer, we're excited to announce that the GRILL is joining the University of Edinburgh [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics). In the Autumn, we will be part of the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) (ILCC), one of the world's leading groups in NLP and language technologies. 

As part of this change, Jeff Dalton, the lead GRILL PI receieved a prestigious [University of Edinburgh Chancellor's Fellowship](https://www.ed.ac.uk/news/2023/fellowships-recognise-pioneering-research-talent) in "Data, Digital and Artificial Intelligence", an investment to empower in leaders with a vision in research to empower innovative research and forge industry partnerships. See the announcement from the University and [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/news/2023/school-of-informatics-chancellors-fellows-2023). 

We look forward to be part of these ambitious goals and to continue our group's research on developing the future of conversational AI assistants like Alexa, ChatGPT, and beyond. We look forward to collaborating with our colleages in the ILCC including [Edinburgh NLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/) to realize this vision. 

As part of this transition the GRILL Lab name is also be updating its full name to be the: "Generalized Representation and Information Learning Lab".

<strong>More news:</strong>

- PhD student [Carlos Gemmell](https://carlos-gemmell.github.io/) is doing an research internship at Meta in London working on the future of [tool-enabled language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761).
- Lab members will be presenting at the First UK AI Fellows conference ([UKAI2023](https://uk-ai.org/ukai2023/)) next week.
- And there multiple research publications at SIGIR - stay tuned for more details!

<strong>The GRILL lab will have an opening for a postdoc research position in Conversational AI at the University of Edinburgh starting in Autumn 2023. If you're interested please reach out via email or social media to Dr. Dalton directly. <strong>
